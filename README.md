Published constellations for the "On Fiber Nonlinearity Mitigation via 4D Geometric Shaping for Next-generation Single-span Systems" paper

Constellations are published both in MATLAB format (.mat) and in plain text format (.txt in scientific notation)  
The binary labeling is equal to the binary representation of the row index of the constellation  
The constellations are normalized to have unit power per polarization

The reference 4D AWGN constellations in the paper are taken from https://doi.org/10.5522/04/20223963

Naming of the constellation files is as follows: `<1>_<2>_<3>_<4>_<5>_<6>.mat/.txt`
1. Data rate in Gbit/s
2. Number of bits per 4D-sym
3. Symbol rate in GBd
4. Fiber length in km
5. Launch power in dB
6. Target NGMI (including 0.05 coding gap overhead)
